:zap: COMP 20 Lab: The Epic Fail :zap:
Genevieve Silverman (gsilve02)

1. I believe that after much trial and error, everything in this
   lab has been correctly implemented.

2. I only received help from Ming for this assignment.

3. I spent probably 1.5-2 hours on this lab because I was having 
   syntax problems that took a while to figure out. Moreover,
   I didn't remember that when to call a function in Javascript, you
   leave out the double parenthesis after its name and before the 
   semi-colon.
