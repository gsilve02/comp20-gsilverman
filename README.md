#COMP20 - Genevieve Silverman#

1) This is a repository to hold all of the code I wrote for my COMP20 course 
at Tufts. This repository allows my professor, Ming, to review my code.

2) My favorite homework from this course was developing my personal website 
because I got to personalize it and just have fun.

3) I have grown **SO** much from this course. I have a better understanding 
of the front-end and back-end of web development, I can use Git and GitHub, 
I have a personal webpage, I know how to find resources to help me when I'm 
stuck or just curious about concepts, I know to think about the security of 
my applications (never trust user input!), and much more.

4) The most important thing that I learned from this course would probably be 
to have confidence in myself to work on a project even if I'm unsure how to 
complete it at the beginning. I now know how to find resources to answer my 
questions when there isn't a TA or professor to help me. I'm also know that 
if I put in the time, I will get the task done no matter how challenging.

5) Now that I have finished the course, I would like to learn more about 
application security. It's scary to think that your code could affect 
people negatively in the future if it compromises their information. However, 
it's also exciting to think that I could be able to hack something. 



* `annotation` contains files for a webpage that plays a video of Mariah
Carey from New Years Eve 2017 and displays the lyrics to her song below the
video.

* `notuber` contains files for a webpage that utilizes Google Maps' API to mark
a client and other past users on a Google Map. The user's location is retrieved
using geolocation and the other past users' locations are retrieved using
a datastore that returns JSON data. AJAX methods are implemented to make
the JavaScript work.

* `responsive` contains files for a webpage that uses a sprite and displays
a different portion of the sprite based on the size of the webpage's window.

* `messages` contains files for a webpage that receives JSON data from a server
containing information about messages different users are sending. This JSON
data gets parsed and displayed on the webpage.

* `security` analyzes any security issues I could find in my classmates webapp
using node.js, mongoDB, and the Google Maps API.
