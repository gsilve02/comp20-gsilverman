#COMP20 - Genevieve Silverman#

This is my private repository for the COMP20: Web Programming class at Tufts.

* `annotation` contains files for a webpage that plays a video of Mariah
Carey from New Years Eve 2017 and displays the lyrics to her song below the
video.

* `notuber` contains files for a webpage that utilizes Google Maps' API to mark
a client and other past users on a Google Map. The user's location is retrieved
using geolocation and the other past users' locations are retrieved using
a datastore that returns JSON data. AJAX methods are implemented to make
the JavaScript work.

* `responsive` contains files for a webpage that uses a sprite and displays
a different portion of the sprite based on the size of the webpage's window.
