#notuber#
*By Genevieve Silverman*

notuber is a web application that locates the client, marks the client's location
on a Google Map, sends their location to a datastore, receives others' locations
from the same datastore, and marks the others' locations on the same Google map.
The client can either be a driver, which means that the locations of passengers
will be displayed on the map, or a passenger, which means that the locations
of other drivers will be displayed on the map. This application is able to
complete this by using Google Map's API and AJAX methods.


1. To the best of my knowledge, all parts of this assignment have been completed
correctly.

2. I collaborated with Ming and COMP 20 TAs for the final bug fixes on this
assignment.

3. I probably spent between 12 and 15 hours on this assignment. It took me hours
to get the base code where you just load a map and your location to open on Google
Chrome. Once I got the base code to work, I was cruising and looking up how implement
the Google Maps API online. A lot of this assignment was trial and error and using
console.log statements to figure out how things worked.


SOURCES:
The base code I used for this assignment was Ming's geoocation_map.html file on
GitHub. This was used for finding my own location and creating a default marker
of my location on a Google Map with their API.
