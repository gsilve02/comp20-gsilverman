#notuber#
*By Genevieve Silverman*

notuber is a web application that locates the client, marks the client's location
on a Google Map, sends their location to a datastore, receives others' locations
from the same datastore, and marks the others' locations on the same Google map.
The client can either be a driver, which means that the locations of passengers
will be displayed on the map, or a passenger, which means that the locations
of other drivers will be displayed on the map. This application is able to
complete this by using Google Map's API and AJAX methods.
