# Assignment 4: Security
*by Genevieve Silverman*

1. I have done as much hacking as I can!
2. I talked to Will Edmonds and Dakota LeRoy about this assignment and that's
where the idea of hard-coding user data (issue #3) came up. I did all of my
analysis on this issue myself. 
3. I spent roughly 5 hours on this assignment :grin:
