        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This web application allows passengers and drivers to find drivers or passengers, respectively, in their area. If a passenger logs on, their location is saved in a mongoDB collection, and they can see the location of recently active drivers in their area that were also stored in a mongoDB collection. If a driver logs on, their location is saved in a database, and they can see the locations of recetly active passengers in their area. Because this application stores sensitive information about its clients, I have been hired to find security vulnerabilities with the application. Below I have documented some of the vulnerabilities I found and have suggested ways to remedy the vulnerabilities so that this app can be safer for its users.</p>
