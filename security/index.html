        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This web application allows passengers and drivers to find 
        drivers or passengers, respectively, in their area. If a passenger 
        logs on, their location is saved in a mongoDB collection, and they 
        can see the location of recently active drivers in their area that 
        were also stored in a mongoDB collection. If a driver logs on, their 
        location is saved in a database, and they can see the locations 
        of recetly active passengers in their area. Because this application 
        stores sensitive information about its clients, I have been hired 
        to find security vulnerabilities with the application. Below I 
        have documented some of the vulnerabilities I found and have 
        suggested ways to remedy the vulnerabilities so that this app 
        can be safer for its users.</p>

                <li>Issue 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
                        <ul>
                              <li>Location: <p class="description">vulnerability

                              </p></li>
                              
                              <li>Severity: <p class="description">High -- 
                              XSS is a high severity vulnerability because 
                              it allows hackers to completely manipulate 
                              your webpage into whatever they want through 
                              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></li>
                              
                              <li>Description: <p class="description">I 
                              found this vulnerability through the POST 
                              '/submit' method and the GET '/' method. 
                              The POST method allows one to add documents 
                              to the mongoDB without filtering the username 
                              content. The GET method then accesses the 
                              username content and puts it into HTML format 
                              so that it can be added to the webpage's file. 
                              This allows for usernames containing 
                              JavaScript to be executed when 
                              https://polar-spire-83537.herokuapp.com/ is 
                              loaded. I found this just by playing around 
                              with curl and the POST '/submit' method. 
                              </p></li>

                                </p></li>

                                found this vulnerability through the POST 
                                '/submit'. When a POST request is sent, 
                                the lat and lng parameters are never checked 
                                for accuracy. They are converted to floats, 
                                but the server never actually checks that it 
                                was completely converted to a float after or 
                                that the lat and lng were in valid ranges. 
                                This fault allowed me to submit lat and lng 
                                values that were out of range and lat and 
                                lng values that weren't floats. In both 
                                cases the data still ended up in the 
                                database. This could be a problem in the 
                                future if the creator changes the maps from 
                                Google Maps to another source if that source 
                                does not validate lat and lng before 
                                rendering pin-points on the map. </p></li>

                                This can be easily remidied by adding a

                                the database and returning a boolean 
                                indicating if the lat and lng values 
                                are valid. This check should go after the 
                                lat and lng have been converted to floats. 
                                In this function, the lat and lng can be 
                                checked to see if they're both in range and 
                                if they're actually floats.</p></li>
