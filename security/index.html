        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="description">This web application allows passengers and drivers to find 
        drivers or passengers, respectively, in their area. If a passenger 
        logs on, their location is saved in a mongoDB collection, and they 
        can see the location of recently active drivers in their area that 
        were also stored in a mongoDB collection. If a driver logs on, their 
        location is saved in a database, and they can see the locations 
        of recetly active passengers in their area. Because this application 
        stores sensitive information about its clients, I have been hired 
        to find security vulnerabilities with the application. Below I 
        have documented some of the vulnerabilities I found and have 
        suggested ways to remedy the vulnerabilities so that this app 
        can be safer for its users.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p class="description">The first strategy that I used for this 
        assignment was to play around with the application to see if I could 
        come up with hacks on my own. Once I did that for a while, I decided
        to go and look at my partner's code to see if I could identify 
        more vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h3>Abstract Findings</h3>
        <p class="description">The first issue I found was that when a user
        submits data, that data is never sanitized. By not sanitizing the data,
        hackers can submit data that tells the web browser to do sneaky 
        things that will ruin the functionality of the application. The
        second issue I found was that the data that was submitted was never
        validated thoroughly enough. This allows unusable data to go into the
        database and clog it up. The last issue I found was that in public
        code, all of the drivers' usernames are listed out. This is bad 
        because it compromises the privacy of drivers and allows others to 
        assume their identity.</p>

        <h3>Issues Found</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Issue 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
                        <ul>
                              <li>Location: <p class="description">vulnerability

                              effects at https://polar-spire-83537.herokuapp.com/
                              </p></li>
                              
                              <li>Severity: <p class="description">High -- 
                              XSS is a high severity vulnerability because 
                              it allows hackers to completely manipulate 
                              your webpage into whatever they want through 
                              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></li>
                              
                              <li>Description: <p class="description">I 
                              found this vulnerability through the POST 
                              '/submit' method and the GET '/' method. 
                              The POST method allows one to add documents 
                              to the mongoDB without filtering the username 
                              content. The GET method then accesses the 
                              username content and puts it into HTML format 
                              so that it can be added to the webpage's file. 
                              This allows for usernames containing 
                              JavaScript to be executed when 
                              https://polar-spire-83537.herokuapp.com/ is 
                              loaded. I found this just by playing around 
                              with curl and the POST '/submit' method. 
                              </p></li>

                                or for hackers to compromise others' data
                                </p></li>

                                <li>Description: <p class="description">I 
                                found this vulnerability through the POST 
                                '/submit'. When a POST request is sent, 
                                the lat and lng parameters are never checked 
                                for accuracy. They are converted to floats, 
                                but the server never actually checks that it 
                                was completely converted to a float after or 
                                that the lat and lng were in valid ranges. 
                                This fault allowed me to submit lat and lng 
                                values that were out of range and lat and 
                                lng values that weren't floats. In both 
                                cases the data still ended up in the 
                                database. This could be a problem in the 
                                future if the creator changes the maps from 
                                Google Maps to another source if that source 
                                does not validate lat and lng before 
                                rendering pin-points on the map. </p></li>

                                This can be easily remidied by adding a

                                the database and returning a boolean 
                                indicating if the lat and lng values 
                                are valid. This check should go after the 
                                lat and lng have been converted to floats. 
                                In this function, the lat and lng can be 
                                checked to see if they're both in range and

                                because it compromises every driver's 
                                privacy. This may also allow people to assume
                                the identity of the driver since they can 
                                just take that username, set it as their own
                                and act as a driver. This is a huge risk to
                                potential passengers because they think they're
                                getting a verified driver, but they're not.
                                This raises the issue of verification. This 
                                app has none. All you need is a username, no
                                passwords.</p></li>

                                usernames. I would also suggest adding an
                                additional verification step of passwords
                                so that strangers can't just pose as drivers
                                if they get the username of a driver.</li>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="description">I didn't realize how difficult it would be to
        hack a simple application. I was just assuming that we would be able
        to hack these applications to the moon and back; however, that was
        seemingly not the case. Most of the vulnerabilities with this web
        applicaiton stem back to the idea that one should never trust user 
        input. Input should be sanitized before it ever gets put into the HTML
        DOM or a database. Before this app moves forward, all user input
        should really be sanitized before being used. Additionally, I woul add
        extra layers of security checks such as requiring passwords with 
        usernames. When an app collects confidential information from its users,
        the developer should really invest in protecting the privacy of the
        users. I would suggest investing a lot of money making this app secure
        now before you move on. </p>

        <h3>Side Notes</h3>
        <p class="description">In trying to hack my partner's application, I
        realized little unconscious security vulnerabilities that I had in 
        my application. For instance, I tried really hard to perform a mongodb
        injection on my partner's application, but I couldn't. I think this
        was because he took in the username parameter for the GET 
        '/vehicles.json' and then only searched for one instance of that
        username, making it so that the application could not return multiple
        documents from the database at once. I did not take this step in my 
        application; instead, I just looked for all occurences of a username 
        (as I expected there to only be one of each username because I updated
        old entried with the same username). However, this caused my application
        to better allow a hacker to perform mongodb injection on me. </p>
